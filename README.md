# ACCESSIBILITY.md

This repository is home to [a skill](https://agentskills.io) for your AI agents to ensure they develop accessible codebases.

It is highly recommended to **conduct periodic manual accessibility reviews**. This can include tasks like navigating the site with a screen reader (e.g., NVDA or VoiceOver) to ensure content is read in a sensible order, testing all functions with only the keyboard, and trying high-contrast or zoom settings to see if the UI remains usable. Especially in cases where AI agents are doing most of the development work, engaging an accessibility expert or beta users with disabilities to evaluate the product can provide critical feedback. Manual testing validates the real user experience and catches nuances that rules-based checkers might miss.
